# DU Profile Scripts

These scripts could really be moved to DDEV commands, but then they would not be useful when 
ddev is not running. Not sure the best place to put these.

## Scripts

- `bootstrap-local.sh` - Bootstraps a local Drupal site for development and testing.
- `bootstrap-ci.sh` - Bootstraps a Drupal site for CI testing on GitHub.
